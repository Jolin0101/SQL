**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.
I will incorporate considerations and trasparency into my work which can help ensure fairness, respect and inclusivity for all individuals involved. By actively avoiding rasism, bias, and discrimination, and by respecting the diversity of perspectives and experiences, to contribute creating a more equitable and harmonious environment.
